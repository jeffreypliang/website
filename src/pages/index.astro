      <p>
        I'm a software engineer at Databricks, improving the reliability and
        performance of 
        <a href="https://www.databricks.com/blog/introducing-databricks-lakeflow" target="_blank">

        </a> and

      <p>
        Previously, I completed two software engineering internships at Google,
        where I worked on Google Maps data infrastructure and Google Ads
        <a href="https://ads.google.com/intl/en_us/home/campaigns/performance-max/" target="_blank">
          Performance Max campaigns
        </a>.
        I graduated with a bachelor's degree in computer science from the
        University of California, Berkeley, where I also TA'd the
        <a href="https://cs186berkeley.net/" target="_blank">
          database systems course
        </a>
        for four semesters.

        In my free time, I enjoy reading, listening to podcasts, solving
        puzzles, and going on long walks.
